These are the step-by-step procedures that I follow for installing my new NAS/Harvester on Ubuntu 20.04LTS

1) Install Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Server
   - Select Updated Installer
   - Select openssh-server
   - Configure 2 x SSD for RAID1 Software RAID for OS
   - Configure Internal and External Network Interfaces
   - Add 'chia' user with password
   - Allow installation of all security updates
   - Reboot
2) Log in and test network connections
3) Adjust /etc/ssh/sshd_config as desired
4) vi /etc/.bashrc
   - Uncomment: force_color_yes
   - Adjust prompt as desired
   - source /etc/.bashrc
5) vi /etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml
   - Adjust MTU to 9000 for internal 10Gbe interface
   - netplan tyr
   - netplan apply
6) Add following to crontab: @reboot /sbin/ifconfig eno2 txqueuelen 10000
7) git clone https://github.com/rjsears/chia_plot_manager.git
8) mv chia_plot_manager plot_manager
9) cd plot_manager
10) chmod +x install.sh
11) ./install.sh install
12) Complete installation script as necessary
13) If you had directory structure created for you, adjust to eliminate drives as necessary
    For example, in my case I use drive0 and drive1 bays for the two SSD OS drives so I
    removed those drives from `/mnt/enclosure0/front/column0` so that drive_manager.py
    would not put plots on them.
14) Reboot to verify all software and changes took
15) After reboot check the following:
    - Correct network connectivity
    - ip a and look for your internal interface: 3: eno2: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 9000 qdisc mq state UP group default qlen 10000
    - Verify MTU and qlen
16) vi /etc/sysctl.conf and very performance enteries at the bottom
17) df -h to verify snap removal
19)
